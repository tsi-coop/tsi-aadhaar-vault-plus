# TSI Aadhaar Vault Plus

A secure, and compliant solution for organizations to manage Aadhaar ID.

The "Plus" in the solution's name signifies its expanded capability to securely vault other sensitive Indian identification numbers like Voter ID and ABHA ID, providing a unified and extensible framework for managing diverse sensitive identifiers.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your development machine or server:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher**: Required to build and run the Java application.
    * **Installation Steps:**
        * **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
            ```bash
            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
            ```
        * **Windows:** Download the JDK 17 installer from Oracle (requires account) or Adoptium (Eclipse Temurin, recommended open-source distribution) and follow the installation wizard. Ensure `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set and `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` is in your system's `Path`.
    * **Verification:**
        ```bash
        java -version
        javac -version
        ```

* **Apache Maven 3.6.0 or higher**: Project build automation tool.
    * **Installation Steps:**
        * **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
            ```bash
            sudo apt install maven
            ```
        * **Windows:** Download the Maven binary zip from the Apache Maven website, extract it, and add the `bin` directory to your system's `Path` environment variable.
    * **Verification:**
        ```bash
        mvn -v
        ```

* **Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine + Docker Compose)**: Essential for containerizing and running the application and database locally.
    * **Installation Steps:**
        * **Windows:** Download and install Docker Desktop from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
        * **Linux:** Follow the official Docker Engine installation guide for your specific distribution (e.g., [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)). Install Docker Compose separately if using Docker Engine.
    * **Configuration & Verification (Windows Specific):**
        * Ensure **WSL 2** is enabled and configured. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run `wsl --install` or `wsl --update`.
        * Verify **virtualization (Intel VT-x / AMD-V)** is enabled in your computer's BIOS/UEFI settings.
        * Start Docker Desktop and wait for the whale icon in the system tray to turn solid.
    * **Verification:**
        ```bash
        docker --version
        docker compose version # Or docker-compose --version for older installations
        ```

* **Git**: For cloning the repository.
    * **Installation Steps:**
        * **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
            ```bash
            sudo apt install git
            ```
        * **Windows:** Download the Git for Windows installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and follow the installation wizard.
    * **Verification:**
        ```bash
        git --version
        ```

* **AWS Account & KMS Key Configuration**:
    * **AWS Account:** An active AWS account.
    * **AWS KMS Key Creation:**
        1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to **Key Management Service (KMS)**.
        2.  In the left navigation pane, select **Customer managed keys**.
        3.  Click **Create key**.
        4.  Choose **Symmetric** key type and **Encrypt and decrypt** key usage.
        5.  (Optional) Add aliases and tags.
        6.  Define **Key administrators** (IAM users/roles who can manage this key).
        7.  Define **Key usage permissions** (IAM users/roles who can use this key for crypto operations).
        8.  Review and finish creation.
    * **Obtain Key Identifier:** Note down the **Key ARN** or create a user-friendly **Alias ARN** (e.g., `alias/your-aadhaar-vault-key`). This will be used as `KMS_KEY_IDENTIFIER`.
    * **IAM User/Role Permissions:** Ensure the IAM user whose `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` you use locally (or the IAM role your application uses in production) has the following permissions on your specific KMS key:
        * `kms:GenerateDataKey`
        * `kms:Encrypt`
        * `kms:Decrypt`

## Installation Steps (Docker)

Follow these steps to get the TSI Aadhaar Vault Plus solution running on your local machine using Docker Compose:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tsi-cooperative/tsi-aadhaar-vault-plus.git
    cd tsi-aadhaar-vault-plus
    ```

2.  **Create `.env` File:**
    This file stores sensitive configurations (passwords, API keys, etc.) and is **NOT** committed to Git.
    ```bash
    cp .example .env
    ```
    Now, **edit the newly created `.env` file** and fill in the placeholder values:
    * `POSTGRES_DB`,`POSTGRES_USER`,`DB_PASSWORD`: Database Configuration
    * `TSI_LOOKUP_SALT`: A long, random, cryptographically secure string.
    * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS credentials for local testing.
    * `AWS_REGION`: Your AWS region (e.g., `ap-south-1`).
    * `AWS_KMS_KEY_IDENTIFIER`: The ARN or Alias ARN of your KMS Key (e.g., `alias/your-aadhaar-vault-key`).

3.  **Build the Java WAR File:**
    Navigate to the project root and build your Java application.
    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```
    This will create `target/tsi_aadhaar_vault_plus.war`.

4.  **Initialize PostgreSQL Database Schema:**
    The `postgres` Docker image only runs initialization scripts on its *first* startup when the data directory is empty. To ensure your schema is loaded:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v 
    ```

5.  **Build and Start Docker Services:**
    This command will build your application's Docker image and start both the PostgreSQL database and the Jetty application.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    * `--build`: Ensures Docker images are rebuilt, picking up any changes in your Java code or Dockerfile.
    * `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

6.  **Verify Services and Check Logs:**
    * Check if containers are running: `docker ps`
    * Monitor PostgreSQL logs for schema initialization: `docker-compose logs -f postgres_db`
    * Monitor Jetty application logs for successful deployment: `docker-compose logs -f jetty_app`

## Installation Steps (without Docker)

These steps describe how to install and run the TSI Aadhaar Vault Plus solution directly on a Linux/Windows server without using Docker.

1.   **Clone the Repository:**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/tsi-cooperative/tsi-aadhaar-vault-plus.git
     cd tsi-aadhaar-vault-plus
     ```

2.  **PostgreSQL Database Setup:**
    * Log in as the PostgreSQL superuser (e.g., `postgres` user on Linux).
    ```bash
    sudo -i -u postgres psql
    ```
    * Create the database and user:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE <<your-db-name-here>>;
    CREATE USER <<your-db-user-here>> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<<your_db_password_here>>';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <<your-db-name-here>> TO <<your-db-user-here>>;
    ```
    * Exit the postgres user: `exit`
    * **Initialize Schema:** Execute the `db/init.sql` script to create the necessary tables.
    ```bash
    psql -U <<your-db-user-here>> -d <<your-db-name-here>> -h localhost -f /path/to/tsi-aadhaar-vault-plus/db/init.sql
    ```

3.  **Build WAR:**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/tsi-aadhaar-vault-plus
    mvn clean package
    ```
    This will generate `target/tsi_aadhaar_vault_plus.war`.

4.  **Deploy Solution (linux):**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/tsi-aadhaar-vault-plus/server
    cp .example .env
    ```
    Now, **edit the newly created `.env` file** and fill in the placeholder values.
   
    ```bash
    ./set-base.sh #Sets the jetty base directory
    ./serve.sh # Copies the target/tsi_aadhaar_vault_plus.war to %JETTY_BASE%/webapps/ROOT.wat. Starts the server in 8080
    ```
5. **Deploy Solution (windows):**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/tsi-aadhaar-vault-plus/server
   copy .example .env
   ```
   Now, **edit the newly created `.env` file** and fill in the placeholder values.
   
   ```bash
   set-base.bat #Sets the jetty base directory
   serve.bat # Copies the target/tsi_aadhaar_vault_plus.war to %JETTY_BASE%/webapps/ROOT.wat. Starts the server in 8080
   ```
####  **Security Note:** For production, **never hardcode AWS credentials or salts**. Use a secure secrets management solution like AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve them programmatically.
